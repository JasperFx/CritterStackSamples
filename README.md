# CritterStackSamples

Sample projects using the "Critter Stack" Tools ([Marten](https://martendb.io) and [Wolverine](https://wolverinefx.net)) and related [JasperFx](https://github.com/jasperfx) projects.

Most of these samples will require Docker container support using something like [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to run infrastructure.
